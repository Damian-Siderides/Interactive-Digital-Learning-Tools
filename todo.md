	mean 		correct/total
	median		middle value
	mode 		probably n/a in this context
	highest		max
	lowest		min

	streak

## TODO

idea - flash teh correct answer if they are incorrect

vhdl code block guesser						Done for logic gates
more problems
fix kmap table spacing 						doable with html thing
stats page look nice
user confirmation on success and fails		Complete		implement a flash?
read all webdevelopment material

fix the code
profile picture thing and or username so users know who is logged in
square panel, with image for each option on the home screen for greater visual appeal
add to github

ask if it is okay to put lecture slides on github

survey
results

code guesser problem
	logic gates
	other statements

## Extra idea that i wont be implementing

differentiate anon users by ip address? - interesting idea that won't be implemented

## Thesis notes

have to make my project relevant to digital learning

What have i created?

I have created several problems that allow a studentto select an answer and be immidietlyey graded

A database that tells users statistics regarding their data

	This enables users to locate areas of weakness

questions are randomly generated

	this enables students to have access to a very large pool of questions in some cases
	allows them to practice a large amount of questions
	practice them very fast
	be given instant feedback so they can check their mistakes
	be given access to their statistics so they can check their progress
		a time lapse of scores could be useful with statistics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky

the paper talks about games being motivating compared to traditional education

e learning

Digital game-based learning: Impact of instructions and feedback on motivation and learning effectiveness - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513000699
	This explanation fits in with the findings of Corbalan et al. (2009) and Spinath and Spinath (2005) showing that the presence of feedback gives learners an opportunity not just to take stock of the progress they have made, but also to improve their self-regulation.

	paper references that talk about self regulation

	knowledge of correct response feedback (KCR)

This paper describes a study where they attempt to measure different types of instruction ie (learning instruction vs entertainment instruction)
paper talks about deep learning, whereas my project is more about practice, not so much learning
